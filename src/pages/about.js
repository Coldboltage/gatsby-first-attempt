      <p>Well I should probably write something about myself here but actually I'm going to only write something about something that I should write but I'm not actually going to write something about myself and you'll just have to bare with me for now until I figure out how to use Gatsby.</p>
      <p>I certainly like using this though. It feels a lot more organised and I hope to actually make some use out of this!</p>
